To create a **Frozen Job Market Index** similar in structure to your **Housing Market Index**, you'll want to pull relevant labor market metrics from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov) and potentially supplement with BLS data. Below is a clear breakdown in the same style, mapping datasets, engineered features, and the composite formula.

# üßä Frozen Job Market Index ‚Äî Methodology and Data Sources

To quantify **how frozen** a metropolitan job market is, we create a **composite index** that captures labor demand, employment flow, and labor force friction. A ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù market reflects low mobility, low hiring, high slack, and high distress.

## üßÆ Composite Frozen Market Index Formula

This is an inverse index: **higher values = more frozen conditions** (e.g. high slack, low hiring):

```python
Frozen_Market_Index = (
    0.25 * Unemployment_Rate +
    0.20 * Inactive_Workforce_Share +
    0.20 * (1 - Quits_to_Layoffs_Ratio) +
    0.15 * (1 - Job_Openings_to_Unemp) +
    0.10 * Temp_Work_Share +
    0.10 * Low_Mobility_Proxy
)
```

* All features should be standardized (z-scores) across metros
* `(1 - ...)` used where low values are worse (e.g. job openings ratio)
* Index can be rescaled from 0 to 100 for readability

---

## ‚úÖ Notes

* You can adjust weights based on local economic theory or business needs
* This index emphasizes **labor demand**, **mobility**, and **participation**
* Optional: create a ‚ÄúThaw Index‚Äù by inverting the score
