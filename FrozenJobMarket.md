You're absolutely right ‚Äî the **JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey)** data is **only available at the national and regional level**, not for **metropolitan areas**.

So to build a **Frozen Job Market Index at the metro level**, we‚Äôll need to **rely entirely on Census data (ACS)** and other datasets available **by metro area**. Here's a revised version using only data you can get **from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov)** or **BLS local area unemployment statistics (LAUS)** where applicable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Engineered for Frozen Market Index (Metro-Scoped)

## üßÆ Composite Frozen Market Index Formula

Here‚Äôs a simplified version using only **metro-available features**:

```python
Frozen_Market_Index = (
    0.25 * Unemployment_Rate +
    0.20 * NILF_Share +
    0.15 * (1 - Recent_Job_Mobility) +
    0.15 * Retail_Hospitality_Share +
    0.15 * (1 - Remote_Capable_Share) +
    0.10 * Public_Sector_Share
)
```

* Invert mobility and remote share so that **low values = more frozen**
* Use **z-score normalization** or min-max scale before aggregation
* Can rescale output to 0‚Äì100 for intuitive visualization

---

## ‚úÖ Notes

* **No JOLTS or CES components** ‚Äî this version is fully metro-compliant
* You can proxy labor tightness by combining NILF and industry structure
* Optional: If you have monthly LAUS data, compute a **trailing average or change** to add time sensitivity

Would you like a pre-built `pandas` script or SQL schema to construct this index using ACS + LAUS metro data?
