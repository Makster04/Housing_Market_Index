# Housing_Market_Index
To calculate a **Housing Market Index** per metropolitan area using data from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov), youâ€™ll need to compile a **composite index** from a variety of housing-related variables. Below is a structured table of relevant **topics and tables** you should search for, based on commonly used indicators in housing market health assessments (e.g., affordability, homeownership, construction, vacancy, rents, prices).

### Suggested Composite Index Formula Example

To create a **Housing Market Index**, you might standardize and average components such as:

```
HMI = avg(
  z(Homeownership Rate),
  -z(Median Home Value / Median Income),
  -z(Rent Burden),
  -z(Vacancy Rate),
  z(Construction Rate per 1,000 households)
)
```

Let me know if you'd like help building this in Python or joining these datasets!
