# üè† Housing Market Index ‚Äî Methodology and Data Sources

To calculate a **Housing Market Index** (HMI) for each metropolitan area using data from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov), we compile a **composite score** capturing affordability, supply-demand balance, cost burdens, and new construction. Below is the full breakdown of **data sources**, **engineered features**, and the **composite index formula**.

| `Affordability_Ratio` | `Median_Home_Value / MedianHouseholdIncome`                                       | High = less affordable                   |

## üßÆ Composite Housing Market Index Formula

The **Housing Market Index** is a weighted average of standardized (z-score) features, structured as follows:

```python
Housing_Market_Index = (
    0.25 * Recent_Units_Share +
    0.20 * (New_Housing_Units / Total_Housing_Units) +
    0.20 * (MedianHouseholdIncome / Median_Home_Value) +
    0.15 * (1 - High_Rent_Burden) +
    0.10 * (1 - Owner_Cost_Burden) +
    0.10 * (1 - Vacancy_Rate)
)
```

* All percentages should be converted to decimals (e.g., 30% ‚Üí 0.30)
* Inverses (`1 - ...`) are used so higher scores consistently indicate *better* housing conditions
* Optionally, scale each variable using z-scores for comparability before aggregation

## ‚úÖ Notes

* This index balances **affordability**, **availability**, **housing stress**, and **supply growth**
* You can adjust weights to suit local policy emphasis (e.g., give more weight to affordability in high-cost cities)
* The result is a continuous index where **higher values indicate healthier housing markets**
