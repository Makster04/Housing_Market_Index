Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs now translate the **indicators** and **formula** into the **specific datasets** you‚Äôll need to download from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov) or the Census Construction portal, to actually build your **Housing Market Index (HMI)** per metro area.

## üßÆ Composite Index Formula Mapping

Here‚Äôs how your formula:

```python
HMI = avg(
  z(Homeownership Rate),
  -z(Median Home Value / Median Income),
  -z(Rent Burden),
  -z(Vacancy Rate),
  z(Construction Rate per 1,000 households)
)
```

Maps to **data sources**:

| **Formula Term**                        | **Derived From**                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `z(Homeownership Rate)`                 | `B25003` ‚Äì Owner / Total Occupied Housing Units                          |
| `-z(Median Home Value / Median Income)` | `B25077` / `B19013`                                                      |
| `-z(Rent Burden)`                       | `B25070` ‚Äì % of households spending >30% of income on rent               |
| `-z(Vacancy Rate)`                      | `B25002` ‚Äì Vacant / Total Housing Units                                  |
| `z(Construction Rate)`                  | (New Permits / Total Units or Pop) using `C-40` + `B25001` + `PEPANNRES` |

## üîÅ Time Period

* Use **ACS 1-Year** if you're working only with **large metro areas** (‚â•65,000 pop).
* Use **ACS 5-Year** if you want **coverage across all MSAs**, including small ones.
* Get **C-40 (Annual)** building permit data from [here](https://www.census.gov/construction/bps/).
